Nitric is a framework for rapid Cloud and Serverless application development.

It offers portable building blocks for building on AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. Nitric is opinionated to help you move super fast, but flexible and composable for when things need to get custom.

## How does it work?

Nitric is a unique way of building and deploying projects. Our approach eliminates the need for infrastructure configuration in a separate deployment project. As a bonus feature your application can be deployed to any cloud.

### Develop

Write your code using the Nitric SDK with powerful resources configured for production ready infrastructure including buckets, collections, secrets, queues, messaging and more.

### Run Local (Offline)

Fine tune your application before you deploy to the cloud by running your application offline for rapid iterative development and testing.

### Deploy

Nitric will automatically infer the infrastructure required to run your applications written in any language for all major cloud providers.
